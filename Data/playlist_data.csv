Lyrics:

Ooh
Na na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah)
I said save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

-- | LYRICS |--

The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow
you come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand stop, put van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance
And now I’m singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy don’t mind me 
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body

Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

One week in we let the story begin
We’re going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat 
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family’s doing ok
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
and I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead 
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
Say boy let’s not talk too much 
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now follow my lead
Come come on now follow my lead

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4 
I’m in love with your body
Oh I x 4
I’m in love with your body
Oh I X 4
I’m in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you 

Come on be my baby come on X 8

I’m in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
Last night you were in my room 
And now my bed sheets smell like you 
Every day discovering something brand new

Well I’m in love with your body
Come on be my baby come on X 6
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with the shape of you

JgDNFQ2RaLQ,Ed Sheeran - Sapphire (Official Music Video),"Listen to 'Sapphire' now: https://es.lnk.to/sapphireID

""Sapphire was the first song I finished for Play that made me know where the album was heading. It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it. This is the album version of the song, and my favourite song on the album. Hope you guys love it. Sapphire out now"" - Ed x

Lyrics

You’re glowing
You colour and fracture the light
You can’t help but shine
And I know that
You carry the world on your back
But look at you tonight
The lights


Your face
Your eyes
Exploding
Like fireworks
In the sky
Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning
Go to bed we won’t sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare wargi
Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning
Go to bed we won’t sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare wargi
Look what we found
Karma reached out
Into our hearts and pulled us to our feet now
You know the truth is
We could disappear
Anywhere as long as I got you there
When the sun dies
Till the day shines
When I’m with you
There’s not enough time
You are my spring flower
Watching you bloom, wow
We’re are surrounded but I can only see
The lights
Your face
Your eyes
Exploding
Like fireworks
In the sky


Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning
Go to bed we won’t sleep
Cham cham chamke sitare wargi
Sapphire
Touching on your body while you’re pushing on me
Don’t you end the party
I could do this all week
We’ll be dancing till the morning
Go to bed we won’t sleep

Sapphire
You’re glowing
You’re glowing
You colour and fracture the light
Look at you
Tonight

Lyrics 

I’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

I need somebody to heal
somebody to know
somebody to have
somebody to hold
It’s easy to say
but it’s never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds, into nightfall
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now I need somebody to know 
somebody to heal 
somebody to have 
just to know how it feels
It’s easy to say
but it’s never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Now the day bleeds, into nightfall 
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms 
I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around

For now the day bleeds, into nightfall 
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds, into nightfall 
and you’re not here, to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

LYRICS
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.

Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great)
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha

Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

LYRICS: 

Woke up in a sweat 
Dreams are dripping wet
Haven’t met him yet
But I plan on it 

A hero in my mind
Settled for what's mine
Which is nothing at all
No man breaking down these walls

Please don't call
Don't wake me up from this dream
It’s a true tear
A nightmare
Keep me fast asleep
Don't you dare open up my eyes
Let me feed my mind
I don’t want to see the light ooooo

The phone rings
I let 'em have it 
I can't breathe 
It’s a dirty habit
My hands shake 
Cause I wish I had it
The one now, the one now
The phone rings
I let 'em have it
The bed creaks
It’s a dirty habit 
My brain bleeds
Cause I wish I had it 
The one now, the one now
The one now

I’ve made up my mind
A true love's golden stitch
Pucker up your lips
Cause I’m worth the risk 
A treasure for all time
I’m gonna get what's mine
Run away if you dare
I swear I hold something rare

Please don't call
Don’t wake me up from this dream
It’s a true tear
A nightmare
Keep me fast asleep
Don't you dare open up my eyes
Let me feed my mind
I don't want to see the light ooooo

The phone rings
I let 'em have it 
I can't breathe 
It’s a dirty habit
My hands shake 
Cause I wish I had it
The one now, the one now
The phone rings
I let 'em have it
The bed creaks
It’s a dirty habit 
My brain bleeds
Cause I wish I had it 
The one now, the one now
Bridge
Please don't call (Please don't call)
Don't wake me up (Don’t wake me up)
Don’t break the sleep (Don’t break the sleep)
Cause i don't wanna see the light ooooooo 

The phone rings
I let 'em have it 
I can't breathe 
It’s a dirty habit
My hands shake 
Cause I wish I had it
The one now, the one now
The phone rings
I let 'em have it
The bed creaks
It’s a dirty habit 
My brain bleeds
Cause I wish I had it 
The one now, the one now
The one now
It’s a dirty habit
The one now

Lyrics:
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‘Cause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don’t make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don’t walk away
It’s in the palm of your hand now, baby
It’s a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

(Juicy J)
She’s a beast
I call her Karma
She’ll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
‘Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She’s sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She’ll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I’m gon’ put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don’t care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil’ mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you’re fallin’ for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‘Cause I’m coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‘Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine
There’s no going back

""Let Her Go"" [Lyrics]

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much
And you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

=========================

Earth Is Ghetto by Amarachimusic is a powerful song that explores the struggles, mental battles, and the need for redemption. The heartfelt lyrics express a longing to break free from life’s challenges and rise above them.

=========================

Another day i gotta fight a battle
But my heart can’t another tussle
Mentally I wanna throw in the towel
But checkin’ out aint even an option
I need you now, another man in the fire
To break chains and take me higher
All i want is what you desire
Tick tock i’m down to the wire, cuz

Earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
I need you to save me
Cuz earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
I’m sending an sos
Cuz earth is ghetto

Two shots of pain and sorrow
Emotions locked up in a bottle
The world now feels like an illusion
My presence feels like an intrusion
I need you now, another man in the fire
Tick tock I’m down to the wire
All I want is what you desire
To break chains and take me higher

Earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
I need you to save me
Cuz earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
I’m sending an sos
Cuz earth is ghetto

Oh I waited so long for my getaway
You always brighten up my day x4
I know you never fail me
You’re never one to delay
I know you never fail me
You always come to save me

Earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
I need you to save me
Cuz earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
Earth is ghetto
I’m sending an sos
Cuz earth is ghetto

Oh I waited so long for my getaway
You always brighten up my day
Waited so long for my getaway
You always brighten up my day
Waited so long for my getaway
You always brighten up my day
Waited so long for my getaway
You always brighten up my day

I need you now, another man in the fire (ah ah ah ah)
To break chains and take me higher (ah ah ah ah) x2

Lyrics:
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you
All along I've been coming for you
And I hope it meant something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for you
Coming for you, coming for you, coming for you

For you (ooh, she loves it when I come)
For you

Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you

Lyrics:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can’t be sold 
We were right til we weren’t
Built a home and watched it burn 
 
I didn’t wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
 
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said 
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than you can 
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
Can love me better

🔎 Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors: 
There are no strangers at a Drew Holcomb show. For the better part of two decades, the award-winning songwriter has brought his audience together night after night, turning his shows into celebrations of community, collaboration, and contemporary American roots music. Strangers No More, the ninth album from Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors, celebrates that sense of togetherness. Produced by Cason Cooley, it expands the band's mix of timeless songwriting, modern-day Laurel Canyon folk, amplified Americana, and heartland rock & roll. ""All The Money in the World,"" with its deep-pocketed groove that showcases The Neighbors’ musicality, is punctuated by blasts of brass, marking the band’s first song to feature horns. ""That's On You, That's On Me"" makes room for barrelhouse piano, slide guitar, and the greasy grit of a juke joint rock band. ""On a Roll"" and ""Possibility"" are Springsteen-sized rock & roll melodramas that wail and exalt, their cinematic arrangements built for the large rooms that Holcomb regularly plays these days. ""Fly"" is a reflective, finger-plucked folksong. Finally, there's ""Dance With Everybody,” a lively tribute to the live show that brims with a joyful optimism — a feeling that was often missing during the band’s earlier years, when their shows weren’t nearly as packed. Song by song, Strangers No More offers an all-encompassing view not only of the places Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors have been, but where they're headed next, too. It's an invitation into the band's world. Strangers no more, indeed.

Lyrics:
For a while there it was rough 
But lately I’ve been doing better 
Than the last four cold Decembers
I recall 
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She’ll come and stay the night
I think I might have it all 
And I thank god everyday 
For the girl he sent my way 
But I know the things he gives me
He can take away 
And I hold you every night
That’s a feeling I wanna get used to 
But there’s no man as terrified 
As the man who stands to lose you 
Oh I hope I don’t lose you
Mmm
Please 
Stay
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t 
Take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please don’t take,
I found my mind I’m feeling sane
It’s been a while but I’m finding my faith
If everything’s good and it’s great why do I sit and wait till it’s gone
Oh I’ll tell ya I know I’ve got enough
I got peace,
And I got love,
But I’m up at night thinking I just might lose it all
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please stay
I want you I need you oh god
I need
These beautiful things that I’ve got

“Sally, When The Wine Runs Out” Lyrics: 
Well, I met Sally at a late night dive bar
She don't dance but she downs her drinks
Heard through a friend she's a born again wild card
She was telling me wild things
She was telling me wild things
Lives down the street past the 7-Eleven 
Just close enough that I spent the night
She grabbed my hand at the intersection
I spilled my guys at the red light
 
Sally
That feeling’s coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I’m enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out
 
I open up while she's flipping through pages
Getting lonely as the days get dark
If you’re bored and your mind starts changing
Maybe just give me a head start
And I, I see the glass in your eyes
Just trying to keep it alive, for crying out loud
 
Sally
That feeling’s coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I’m enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out
 
Oh shit here we go again
I'm falling headfirst
Ankles hit the two step
Sally makes my head hurt
Heard through the grapevine
She can be diva
Cold like Minnesota
Hotter than a fever
Oh shit here we go again
I'm falling headfirst
Ankles hit the two step
Sally makes my head hurt
Heard through the grapevine
She can be diva
Cold like Minnesota
Hotter than a fever
 
Sally
That feeling’s coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I’m enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out

They say the holy waters watered down and this town's lost it faith
Our colors will fade Eventually
So if our time is running out day after day we’ll make the mundane our masterpiece

PRE
Oh my my Oh my my
Love I take one look at you

CHORUS
Taking me out of
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine the
Angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got
me kissing the ground of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust the
Angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found

VERSE 2
Hopeless hallelujah
Oh this side of heaven’s gates
On my life
How do ya Breathe and Take my breath away
At your alter I will pray
You’re the sculptor I’m the clay
Oh my my

CHORUS
You’re taking me out
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got me kissing the ground
of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found
BRIDGE
Something so heavenly
Higher than ecstasy whenever your next to me
Oh my my world was in black and white until I saw your light)
I thought you had to die to find something so out

CHORUS
Of the ordinary I want you laying me down
Til we’re dead and buried
On the edge of your knife
Staying drunk on your vine
The Angels up in the clouds
Are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary you got me kissing the ground
of your sanctuary shatter me with your touch
Oh lord return me to dust

Lyrics: 
Once I was seven years old my mama told me, 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big, big world but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor 
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me, 
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was twenty years old my story got told
Before the morning sun when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old

I only see my goals I don't believe in failure
‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later

Once I was twenty years old my story got told 
I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old

Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold 
We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one 
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be sixty years old

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

[Verse 2]
Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness
(Ooh) But I know I might resist it, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

🔎BabyJake: Florida-born Jake Herring, known professionally as BabyJake, may have appeared to be an overnight success, but his journey to the spotlight was anything but instantaneous. His hit single Cigarettes on Patios took off in 2019, garnering 200M+ streams and earning him a certified gold record and a major label deal. He would release two albums from the same vine, until the upheaval of the pandemic saw him splitting with his label and at a pivotal turning point.

But giving up was never an option for Jake, and his resilience set him on a new path: an ascetic journey to rediscover himself, shedding his shag haircut in favor of a buzzcut, naked skin marked by the tattoos he collected along his journey. He found the answer on his upcoming album Beautiful Blue Collar Boy, a bouquet of songs rooted in the beauties and hardships of day to day life. Drawing influence from the likes of Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Tweedy, BabyJake stays true to his north star of confident storytelling and songwriting. On Beautiful Blue Collar Boy, Jake trades in the late night parties for the simplicity of authenticity, hard work, and a meaningful life to come home to.

This chapter of BabyJake reveals a man stripped down to his American roots, with each song painting a small vignette of BabyJake’s blue collar dreams. Now planted in Nashville, TN, Jake returns to us as a Beautiful Blue Collar Boy.

Lyrics:
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
 
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar
You’re gonna hear me roar
 
Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‘Cause I am a champion
And you’re gonna hear me roar

Lyrics:

Somethings got a hold of me lately 
No, I don’t know myself anymore 
Feels like the walls are all closing in 
And the devil’s knocking at my door 
Woooahhh
Out of my mind, how many times 
Did I tell you I’m no good at being alone 
Yea, it’s taking a toll on me 
Trying my best to keep from tearing the skin off my bones 
Don’t you know
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me, mhm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart 
You make a mess of me 
Problematic problem is I want your body like a fiend 
like a bad habit 
Bad habits hard to break when I’m with you 
Yeah I know I could do it on my own but I want 
That real full moon black magic and it takes two 
Problematic problem is when I’m with you I’m an addict 
And I need some release 
My skin in your teeth 
Can’t see the forest through the trees 
Got down on my knees 
Darlin, please 
Oooohhhh 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me, mhmmm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart baby 
You make a mess of me, yeahhh 
I lose control 
When you’re not here with me, mhmm 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not here with me, mhm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart baby 
You make a mess of me, yeahhh

Lyrics

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off

[Liam:]
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Louis:]
Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

[Niall:]
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Harry (along all):]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you

6HZd7CzlzmE,Already Dreaming - Nicholas Wells,"I wrote “Already Dreaming” in March of 2004, when I was 15. I have a vivid memory of picking up my guitar one morning before school (which I didn’t usually do but I felt the inspiration for a song,) sitting down on the edge of the bed, and immediately humming the chorus melody. I then went to school, and when I came home I finished writing the whole song, including in the lyrics some moments from my day.

Throughout High School, I used to make little CDs of my home recordings and hand them out to friends. I remember “Already Dreaming” being a favorite, and that then friends would light-heartedly taunt me with lyrics from it for literally 20 years.

Looking back, I think the song speaks a bit to the conflict of darkness and light within me then, and particularly how bright this one light in my life did seem to shine.

One cool thing about this recording- I was able to isolate my vocal in my original home recording from 2004, and in this mix we added it into the choruses as a double to my present day vocal.

Lyrics
Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
Know you're all that I want this life

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?",2024-12-12T02:00:06Z,156055423,1993018,60086,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IpFX2vq8HKw/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpFX2vq8HKw

Lyrics:
One, one, one, one, one...

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...)

One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over him

Lyrics: Sorry – Justin Bieber
 
You gotta go and get 
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies 
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 
 
I know you know that I 
made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once or twice I Mean 
Maybe a couple a hundred times 
So let me oh let me 
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I’m sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I’m sorry now
 
I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me too 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I’m missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

Lyrics: 
Sick and tired of biting my tongue
There's nothing like breaking the rules
Is that so wrong
Oh you can't see my 
Hands are tied but the night feels young
Maybe I've been playing the fool
For way too long 

There's whispers in the kitchen spreading rumors
Treating us like we're famous
Oh I hate to let them down 
We crawl under the covers 
For a moment we could them out
Out, out, out 

I'm not shy of late night talks 
Don't like to fight bad thoughts 
I'm in the mood for new habits 
Oh I know oh I know 
Nobody sees a shadow in the dark 
You pull me close I can't stop 
I'm in the mood and I love it 

Yeh, oh baby I love it 
Oh baby I love it 
(It's just a mood) 

Hit the lights we'll do it our way 
Crossing lines but you make me feel something I can't explain 
So you can't see that I'm 
Just tryna make you mine
And when it gets real
Honey I can't be blamed
Alright 

Whispers in the kitchen spreading rumors treating us like we're famous
Oh I hate to let them down
Oh 

I'm not shy of late night talks 
Don't like to fight bad thoughts
I'm in the mood for new habits
Oh I know oh I know
Nobody sees a shadow in the dark
You pull me close I can't stop 
I'm in the mood and I love it 

Yeh, oh baby I love it
Oh baby I love it
(It's just a mood)
Yeh, oh baby I love
Oh baby I love it
(He's in the mood)

Yeh, do you hear the whispers in the kitchen spreading rumours
Treating us like we're famous
Oh I hate to let them down

Lyrics:

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

LYRICS:
I know I have good judgement
I know I have good taste
It’s funny and it’s ironic
That only I feel that way
I promise ‘em that you’re different
And everyone makes mistakes
But just don’t
 
I heard that you’re an actor
So act like a stand up guy
Whatever devils inside you
Don’t let him out tonight
I tell them it’s just your culture
And everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah I know
 
All I’m asking baby
 
Please please please don’t prove I’m right
Please please please
Don’t bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing
My egos another
I beg you don’t embarrass me
Mother fucker ahhh
Please please please
 
Well I have a fun idea babe
Maybe just stay inside
I know you’re craving some fresh air
But the ceiling fan is so nice
And we could live so happily
If no one knows that you’re with me
I’m just kidding
But really
Kinda
Really
Really
 
Please please please don’t prove I’m right
Please please please
Don’t bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing
My egos another
I beg you don’t embarrass me
Mother fucker ahhh
Please please please
 
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don’t do it in front of me
If you don’t wanna cry to my music
Don’t make me hate you prolifically
Please please please
Please please please
Please
Please
Please

LYRICS
Oh, her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying 
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so, sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look ok, I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are. Yeah.

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Oh, you know, you know, you know, I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So, don't even bother asking if you look ok
You know I'll say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are
The way you are, the way you are
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are. Yeah.

Lyrics:
You know I'm impatient
So why would you leave me waiting outside the station?
When it was like minus 4 degrees 
And I get what you're saying
I just really don't want to hear it right now
Can you shut up for like once in your life?
Listen to me
I took your nice words of advice about
How you think I'm gonna die
Lucky if I turned 33
Okay, so yeah, I smoke like a chimney
I'm not skinny and I pull a Britney
Every other week
But cut me some slack
Who do you want me to be?

'Cause I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you
And you hate the fucking lot

You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot

It's taking you ages
You still don't get the hint
I'm not asking for pages
But one text or two would be nice
And please, don't pull those faces
When I've been out working my arse off all day
It's just one bottle of wine or two
But hey, you can't even talk
You smoke weed just to help you sleep
Then why you're out getting stoned at 4 o'clock
And then you come home to me
And don't say hello
'Cause I got high again
And forgot to fold my clothes

'Cause I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you
And you hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot
You hate the fucking lot

And I'm too messy
And then I'm too fucking clean
You told me, ""Get a job""
And you ask where the hell I've been
And I'm too perfect
'Til I open my big mouth
I want to be me
Is that not allowed?
And I'm too clever
And then I'm too fucking dumb
You hate it when I cry
Unless it's that time of the month
And I'm too perfect
'Til I show you that I'm not
A thousand people I could be for you
And you hate the fucking lot

LYRICS
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Gym Class Heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yea [scratched], check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops (turn it up)
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh (Gym Class Heroes baby!) to sing along to my stereo

Yeah",2011-08-12T20:20:46Z,977722194,8706668,238544,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T3E9Wjbq44E/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3E9Wjbq44E

Lyrics
Holding me back,
Gravity’s holding me back,
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand,
Why don’t we leave it at that?,
Nothing to say,
When everything gets in the way,
Seems you cannot be replaced,
And I’m the one who will stay,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it’s not the same,
 
Answer the phone,
“Harry, you’re no good alone,
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?,
What kind of pills are you on?”,
Ringing the bell,
And nobody’s coming to help,
Your daddy lives by himself,
He just wants to know that you’re well,
Ooh,
 
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
In this world,
It’s just us,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,
You know it’s not the same,
 
Go home,
Get ahead, 
Light speed internet,
I don’t want to talk about the way that it was,
Leave America, 
Two kids follow her,
I don’t want to talk about who’s doing it first,
(Hey!),
 
As it was,
You know it’s not the same as it was,
As it was,
As it was,

LYRICS:

Oh I leave quite an impression 
Five feet to be exact
You’re wondering why half his clothes went missing 
My bodies where they’re at 
Now I’m gone but you’re still layin’ 
Next to me 
One degree of separation
 
(I) Heard you’re back together and if that’s true 
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you’ll 
Taste me 
Too 

Uh huh
 
He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue
(La la la la la la la)
He’s funny now all his jokes hit different 
Guess who he learned that from 
 
Now I’m gone but you’re still layin’
Next to me 
One degree of separation 
 
(I) Heard you’re back together and if that’s true 
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you’ll 
Taste me 
Too 
 
(La la la la la la la)

Every time you close your eyes 
And feel his lips you’re feelin’ mine 
And every time you breathe his air 
Just know I was already there 
You can have him if you like 
I’ve been there done that once or twice 
And singin’ ‘bout it don’t mean I care 
Yeah I know I’ve been known to share 
 
Well I heard you’re back together and if that’s true 
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you’ll 
Taste me 
Too 

Taste me too 
(La la la la la la la)
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you
You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissing you

Lyrics:

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
You know you want me
So don’t keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you’re my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you, yeah
But there are mountains (There are mountains)
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you’re wondering why
Because we’re able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars (Rewrite the stars)
How can you say you’ll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
(The one you were meant to find)
It's not up to you, it's not up to me, yeah
When everyone tells us what we can be (Tells us what we can)
And how can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight (Be ours)

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It’s not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

And how do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
And nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one could say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.

Lyrics
I know you wanted me to stay 
But I can’t ignore the crazy visions of me in LA
And I heard that there’s a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day 

I’m having wicked dreams
Of leaving Tennessee 
Oh, Santa Monica 
I swear it’s calling me 

Won’t make my mama proud
It’s gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl 
I know she’s gonna scream

God, what have you done 
You’re a pink pony girl 
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I’m just having fun 
On the stage in my heels
It’s where I belong down at the 

Pink Pony Club 
I’m gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club 
I’m gonna keep on dancing down in 
West Hollywood 
I’m gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club 

I’m up and jaws are on the floor 
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night’s another reason why I left it all

I thank my wicked dreams 
A year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
You’ve been too good to be 

Won’t make my mama proud 
It’s gonna cause a scene 
She sees her baby girl 
I know she’s gonna scream 

God, what have you done 
You’re a pink pony girl 
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I’m just having fun 
On the stage in my heels
It’s where I belong down at the 

Pink Pony club 
I’m gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony club 
I’m gonna keep on dancing down in 
West Hollywood 
I’m gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony club, Pink Pony club 

Don’t think I’ve left you all behind 
Still love you and Tennessee 
 you’re always on my mind 
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your southern draw a thousand miles away, saying

God, what have you done 
You’re a pink pony girl 
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I’m just having fun 
On the stage in my heels
It’s where I belong down at the 

Pink Pony Club 
I’m gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club 
I’m gonna keep on dancing down in 
West Hollywood 
I’m gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club 

I’m gonna keep on dancing
I’m gonna keep on dancing

LYRICS

Oh hush my dear, it’s been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me darlin’, trust me darlin’

It’s been a loveless year
I’m a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears

Trust me darlin’, trust me darlin’

So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it
I don’t want to fake it
I wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe

But I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
You’re free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring
Oh I’ve been asking, for
Oh I’ve been asking, for problems, problems, problems

I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh I’ve been asking for (trust me darlin’)
Oh I’ve been asking (trust me darlin’), for problems, problems, problems

So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it
I don’t want to fake it
I wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe

But I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
You’re free to go

I can’t breathe
I can’t be
I can’t be what you want me to be
Believe me this one time, believe me

I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I’m a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
You’re free to go

Please believe me
Please believe me",2019-01-24T15:58:49Z,581129400,5042100,106118,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I-QfPUz1es8/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-QfPUz1es8

Lyrics:

I've been here all night (Ariana)
I've been here all day (Nicki Minaj)
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
(Let them hoes know)
I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('Bout nothin')
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
Been tryna hide it
Baby what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me (You got me)
And boy I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them no, 'cause
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
I've been here all night
(Been here all night, baby)
I've been here all day
(Been here all day, baby)
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
Come true yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna menage I got a tricycle
All these bitches, flows is my mini-me
Body smoking, so they call me young Nicki chimney
Rappers in they feelings cause they feelin' me
Uh, I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me
Kissing me, copped the blue box that say Tiffany
Curry with the shot, just tell 'em to call me Stephanie
Gun pop and I make my gum pop
I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop
These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give him up
Can't hear them no, 'cause I
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
I've been here all night
(Been here all night baby)
I've been here all day
(Been here all day baby)
Boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
Come true yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna menage I got a tricycle

About Jake Wesley Rogers: 
Soulful vocal melodies, driving musical arrangements, and artful lyricism are where Jake Wesley Rogers' shines - the sum cascading forward in striking compositions. The results quiet a room - making an immediate appeal to the soul. Rogers' age is starkly contrasted with his immensely powerful lyrics and equally rousing singing voice - an electric stage presence at the intersection of Madonna and James Blake.

Jake Wesley Rogers’ musical journey began in his younger years, inspired by a torrent of coming-of-age questions and fuelled by the vocal powerhouse artists of the time (Adele, Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga). But the adventure he now embarks on is a true voyage of discovery, rendered in song with earnest honesty. What was once a young man finding his way through solitary expression, now emerges an artist embracing a new future standing on the shoulders of his own younger self.

About OurVinyl:
OurVinyl films creative live performances with both emerging and established musicians. Artists they've worked with include Tyler Childers, St. Paul and The Broken Bones, Ed Sheeran, Trevor Hall, Allen Stone, and Dispatch. They always do their best to push the production envelope by filming artists in unique settings that complement the music while capturing studio quality audio regardless of the setting.

It’s all live, all one take, no punching in, no autotune, no cheating. Just high energy and true authenticity.

Lyrics: 
I believe you when you lie to me
You should know that by now
You weave your words inside of me
And I wear them inside out

And he keeps calling me his little queen
Baby's always doing make believe
Every night I cut his widow's peak
'Cause he don't like the way he used to be
There's a fire in the apple tree
A perfect stranger lying next to me
He's playing God with broken figurines
He keeps calling me his little queen
And I believe

I am like an empty house
With an attic full of you
When the flood comes, you're safe and sound
And I'm left stranded on the roof

He keeps calling me his little queen
Baby's always doing make believe
Every night I cut his widow's peak
'Cause he don't like the way he used to be
There's a fire in the apple tree
A perfect stranger lying next to me
He's playing God with broken figurines
He keeps calling me his little queen

And I believe
Oh, I believe

Going, going, going, going gone
Going, going, going, going gone
Going, going, going, going gone
Going, going, going, going gone

He keeps calling me his little queen
Baby's always doing make believe
Every night I cut his widow's peak
'Cause he don't like the way he used to be
There's a fire in the apple tree
A perfect stranger lying next to me
He's playing God with broken figurines
He keeps calling me his little queen
And I believe
Oh, I believe
I believe
I believe

Doesn't it seem so spiritual?
Seem so spiritual?
Doesn't it seem so spiritual?
Seem so spiritual?
Doesn't it seem so spiritual?
Seem so spiritual?

Lyrics: 

The way we said goodbye
Still brings water to my eyes
In my bedroom

I know you said it wouldn’t work 
But I still don’t have the nerve to
Believe you but

When it’s late at night 
And I can’t sleep
I miss the way it was
When we were 23
It’s tearing me up right now
Cause I know I know 

I shouldn’t call you 
Cause it always ends the same
I shouldn’t want to
When I’m passing by your place
I pick up my phone, I
Can’t be left alone, I 
Try to let it go, I 
Know I know better 
I shouldn’t call you 
But I don’t know how, I don’t know how not to 

It’s still my gut reaction 
My insecure attachment 
Can’t stop my heart from racing, 
hands are shaking 
Bound to happen 

In the back of your car 
With your hands on me 
I miss the way it was
When we were 23
It’s tearing me up right now
Cause I know I know 

I shouldn’t call you 
Cause it always ends the same
I shouldn’t want to
When I’m passing by your place
I pick up my phone, I
Can’t be left alone, I 
Try to let it go, I 
Know I know better 
I shouldn’t call you 
But I don’t know how, I don’t know how not to 

It’s been hard to break 
All the habits I made
When you’re one call away 
I can’t stand that
Look on your face
Got it stuck in my brain 
And I hate it but I know that 

I shouldn’t call you 
Cause it always ends the same
I shouldn’t want to
When I’m passing by your place
I pick up my phone, I
Can’t be left alone, I 
Try to let it go, I 
Know I know better 
I shouldn’t call you 
But I don’t know how, I don’t know how not to 
No I don’t know how, I don’t know how not to

5th of November
When I walked you home
that’s when I nearly said it but then said forget it and froze
Do you remember
You probably don’t
Cuz the sparks in the sky took a hold of your eyes while we spoke

Yesterday
drank way too much and stayed up too late
I started to write what i wanna say
deleted the message but i still remember it said

I wish I
was who you drunk texted at midnight
wish I was the reason you stay up till 3 and you can’t fall asleep
waiting for me to reply


I wish I 
was more than just someone you walk by
wish i wasn’t scared to be honest and open
instead of just hoping
you’d feel what i’m feeling inside

april the 7th
And nothing has changed
It’s hard to get by when you’re still on my mind everyday
Sometimes I wonder
If you feel the same
Do we make stupid jokes tryna hide that we’re both too afraid to say

I wish I
was who you drunk texted at midnight
wish I was the reason you stay up till 3 and you can’t fall asleep
waiting for me to reply

I wish I
was more than just someone you walk by
wish I wasn’t scared to be honest and open
instead of just hoping
you’d feel what i’m feeling inside

Oh and here we go again
Destroy myself to keep a friend
Hiding away
Cuz I was afraid you’d say no
I wonder if I cross your mind
Half as much as you do mine
If I tell you the truth
What would you do I don’t know

I wish I
Had sent you that drunk text at midnight
I was just scared it would ruin our friendship
But i really meant it
I wonder how you would reply",2023-02-10T16:00:19Z,185150070,774937,11143,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OqEc_169ywY/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEc_169ywY

LYRICS
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee
Burning through the hours talking

Damn...

I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time cause
I like me better when I'm with you

I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room
Yeah it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking
I might have to tell you something...

Damn…

I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time cause
I like me better when I'm with you

Stay awhile stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me

I like me better when I'm with you
(yes I do, yes I do, babe)
I like me better when I'm with you
(oooh noooooo)
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time cause
I like me better when I'm with you

(I like me, I like me)
(Look who you made me, made me, oh nooooo)
Better when
I like me better when i’m with you

Lyrics:
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this
You, you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

(Lyrics):
[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Cruel Summer Taylor Swift
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new the shape of your body
It's blue the feeling I've got

No rules in breakable heaven

lyrics:

I like the way you kiss me
I like the way you, uh

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I’ll hit it from the back
Just so you don’t get attached 

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I’ll hit it from the back
Just so you don’t get attached 

You bite my lip
Just for the taste
You’re on your knees
I’m on the case

You take the heat
And with such grace
You say we’re done but here u stay

Said you’re scared I’ll let you down
Stick around and you’ll find out
Don’t you wanna make me proud
Cause I’m so proud
Baby I’m so proud of you

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I’ll hit it from the back
Just so you don’t get attached 

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I’ll hit it from the back
Just so you don’t get attached 

Do I stress you out? 
Can I help you out ?
Does it turn you on
When I turn you round?
Can we make a scene
Can we make it loud
Cause I’m so proud
Yeh I’m so proud of you

#JamesArthur #SayYOuWontLetGo

-----------------------------------------------

Lyrics:
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
Finally it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go",2016-09-09T07:00:00Z,1760483199,9336320,189373,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0yW7w8F2TVA/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yW7w8F2TVA

lyrics:
some days i’m feeling
i’m not pretty enough
i’ll take the wheel but
but i won’t get it done
i’m over thinking
till i’m stuck in the mud 
i’m exhausted 
from bad self talking 
 
the devil i know isn’t good enough for me
running uphill till there’s nothing left of me
what would it feel like if i could believe?
all of my doubt is insecurity 
i know my pride can get the best of me
how do i heal when something cut so deep? 
 
i’m so tired, of the story,
i tell myself
somebody else
is more deserving, 
the lies don’t work when 
i’m doing well
but it hurts like hell to hear
the story i tell myself
 
i know i’m worthy
of so much better than this 
it’s hard to think bout
everything that i’ve missed
and being vulnerable
doesn’t feel like a risk
but there’s no hope in
staying broken
 
the devil i know isn’t good enough for me
running uphill till there’s nothing left of me
What would it feel like if i could believe?
 
i’m so tired, of the story,
i tell myself
somebody else
is more deserving, 
the lies don’t work when 
i’m doing well
but it hurts like hell to hear
the story i tell myself
 
and i know that it’s in my mind 
just wanna see what the other side 
looks like, wish i could rewrite 
the story i tell myself 
and i know it’ll be alright 
just wanna step out into the light 
wish i, wish i could rewrite 
the story i tell myself 
 
and i know that it’s in my mind, 
just wanna see what the other side looks like
i…
 
i’m so tired, of the story,
i tell myself
somebody else
is more deserving, 
the lies don’t work when 
i’m doing well
but it hurts like hell to hear
the story i tell myself

Lyrics:

I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two or three times in a row,
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.",2009-10-03T04:47:38Z,889624184,4184338,81056,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ViwtNLUqkMY/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwtNLUqkMY

About Anne-Marie:
Anne-Marie has proved to be one of the UK’s most exciting and successful British breakthrough popstars of recent years. A former 3x world karate champion and West End child star-turned 9x BRIT Award nominee, A-M’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. In 2018 Anne-Marie released her debut album, ‘Speak Your Mind’ which featured the hit singles 'Alarm', 'Ciao Adios', 'Heavy', 'Friends', '2002' and 'Perfect to Me'. She subsequently ended that year as as the UK’s biggest-selling debut artist, selling out headline shows and playing stadium dates supporting long-time friend and champion Ed Sheeran in the process.

She has also sang on and co-written many other hits such as Birthday, Rockabye, Don't Leave Me Alone,  To Be Young, f*ck, i'm lonely and Don't Play, collaborating with the likes of Clean Bandit, Marshmello, David Guetta, Lauv, Rudimental, Doja Cat and KSI, as well as starring on The Greatest Showman: Reimagined soundtrack performing Rewrite the stars alongside James Arthur.

LYRICS
 
It’s fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing but you know the truth
And guess i'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You just wanna love someone who calls you baby

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

I’m cliche 
Who cares 
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And i cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin’  i just need a little air 

Think im gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me baby

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

And when you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands you’re nothing more than his wife 
And when you think about me all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with """"i told you so""""
You know I hate to say , i told you so
You know i hate to say it but, i told you so
Well i told you so 

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You’d have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

He said, are you serious

I’ve been next to you all night and still don’t know what you’re about 
You keep talking
But not much coming out your mouth
Can’t you tell that i want you ?” 
I say, yeah

I would want myself 
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me (ya ya) 
So sure of yourself 
Baby don’t get greedy 
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

I see you eyeing me down
But you’ll never know much past my name 
Or how i’m running this room around
And that i’m still half your age
Yeah you’re l-l-looking at me like i’m some sweet escape 
Obvious that you want me but i said

I would want myself
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself
Baby don’t get greedy
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

He said, “i’m just curious
Is this for real or just an act
Can’t tell if you love or hate me 
Never met someone like that
Drive me so so so crazy
Did you know you got that effect?”
I said, “lemme check”

Yeah
I would want myself
Baby please believe me 
I’ll put you through hell 
Just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself
Baby don’t get greedy
That shit won’t end well (end well)
No it won’t end well

I would want myself
I would want myself
I would want myself
I would want myself
I would want myself

Lyrics:

I don't wanna go
But baby we both know
This is not our time
It’s time to say goodbye
Until we meet again
Cuz this is not the end
It will come a day
When we will find our way

Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I’ll be there

Oh I don't care about them all
Cuz all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
U stuck on me like a tattoo
No I don't care about the pain
I’ll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
U stuck on me like a tattoo

I'm letting my hair down
I'm taking it cool
U got my heart in your hand
Don't lose it my friend
It's all that I got

Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I’ll be there

All I care about is love
Oh oh oh
All I care about is love
U stuck on me like a tattoo",2023-02-25T20:30:00Z,149228696,913854,12625,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4lD0-1Uplms/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lD0-1Uplms

DJUyPfe5akU,Kelsie Kimberlin-Sucker (Official Music Video),"Way too many relationships are one-sided where a partner is taken for granted, or treated shitty.   That is what provided the grist for my new song ""Sucker,"" because I felt like a sucker when I put real effort into a relationship only to ignored or abused and made to feel that it was all my fault.  And then I tried to fix what could not be fixed because the guy was just a jerk.

Like my last three videos, Sucker was filmed in Kyiv during breaks from the filming of my full-length movie.  I worked closely with the great Ukrainian film director Pavlo Khomiuk to come up with a concept that was unique.  So I filmed in a very small space with many different musical instruments to signify that no matter how bad I feel about a toxic relationship, I can always find solace in my music.  The many instruments I played were also a metaphor for the many ways I tried to deal with the toxic relationship. 

Sucker

Where’d you go when I needed you most
You disappeared like a high tailed ghost
Where’d you go when I called you on the phone
I know that you left me here on my own

I’m a sucker, and you showed me
I’m alone now and I need you
I’m a fool here and I’ll be good
If you come back, I’ll be waiting

I’m feeling down and my mood is blue
Life’s not real when I’m without you
I can’t go on feeling this away
I won’t be right till you’re back to stay

You walked out when I looked the other way
I didn’t keep my eye on you boy that day
What will I do when you’re not with me
I’m sittin’ here caged and you’re walking free

I’m a sucker, and you showed me
I’m alone now and I need you
I’m a fool here and I’ll be good
If you come back, I’ll be waiting

Hooo,  hooo

And I’m a sucker

Lyrics
She calls out to the man on the street
""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise

Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise

Just think about it

Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, my Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise

Just think about it
Just think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise

Just think about it

Lyrics:
Tell me that I’m special 
Tell me I look pretty 
Tell me I'm a little angel 
Sweetheart of your city 
Say what I'm dying to hear 
Cause I'm dying to hear you 

Tell me I'm that new thing 
Tell me that I'm relevant 
Tell me that I got a big heart 
Then back it up with evidence 
I need it and I don’t know why 
This late at night 

Isn’t it lonely 
I'd do anything to make you want me 
I'd give it all up if you told me 
That I'd be 
The number one girl in your eyes 
Your one and only 
So what’s it gon’ take for you to want me 
I’d give it all up if you told me 
That I’d be 
The number one girl in your eyes 

Tell me I’m going real big places
Down to earth so friendly 
And even through all the phases 
Tell me you accept me 
Well that’s all I'm dying to hear 
Yeah I'm dying to hear you 

Tell me that you need me 
Tell me that I’m loved 
Tell me that I’m worth it 
And that I’m enough 
I need it and I don’t know why 
This late at night 

Isn’t it lonely 
I'd do anything to make you want me 
I'd give it all up if you told me
That I'd be 
The number one girl in your eyes 
Your one and only 
So what’s it gon’ take for you to want me 
I’d give it all up if you told me 
That I’d be 
The number one girl in your eyes 

The girl in your eyes 
The girl in your eyes 
Tell me I’m the number one girl 
I'm the number one girl in your eyes 
The girl in your eyes 
The girl in your eyes 
Tell me I'm the number one girl 
I'm the number one girl in your eyes 

Well isn't it lonely 
I'd do anything to make you want me
 I'd give it all up if you told me 
That I'd be 
The number one girl in your eyes 

Your one and only 
So what’s it ‘gon take for you to want me 
I’d give it all up if you told me 
That I’d be 
The number one girl in your eyes 
The number one girl in your eyes

Lyrics
 
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on
Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree

LYRICS:
Oh it’s like that
I’m your dream come true
When it’s on a platter for you
then you pull back
When i try to make plans
More than 2 hours in advance
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I’m saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
After this
An after thought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You’re a waste of time
Your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
It Feels
So
Good
Not caring where u are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretending to like the wine u like
I slam the door
I hit ignore
I’m saying no no no no more i
Got u blocked
Excited
To never talk
I I’m so sorry for your loss
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
with you off my mind
Floating through
The memories like whatever
You’re a waste of time
your Signals are Mixed
You act like a bitch
you fit every stereotype
send a pic
I feel so much lighter
Like a feather
With you out my life
You want me
I’m done
You miss me
No duh
Where I’m at
I’m up
/ like a feather like a feather like a feather

Official “Circles” Lyrics

We couldn’t turn around
Til we were upside down
I’ll be the bad guy now
But know I ain’t too proud
I couldn’t be there
Even when I tried
You don’t believe it
We do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame because we can’t let go
Runaway but we’re running in circles
Runaway, runaway
I dare you to do something
I’m waiting on you again
So I don’t take the blame
Runaway but we’re running in circles
Runaway, runaway, runaway

Let go
I got a feeling that it’s time to let go
I said so
I knew that this was doomed from the get go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes, the echoes
I got a feeling that it’s time to let it go
Let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame because we can’t let go
Runaway but we’re running in circles
Runaway, runaway
I dare you to do something
I’m waiting on you again
So I don’t take the blame
Runaway but we’re running in circles
Runaway, runaway, runaway

Maybe you don’t understand what I’m going thru
It’s only me, what you got to lose
Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do
It’s only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame because we can’t let go
Runaway but we’re running in circles
Runaway, runaway
I dare you to do something
I’m waiting on you again
So I don’t take the blame
Runaway but we’re running in circles
Runaway, runaway, runaway

“I Ain’t Worried” Lyrics:
i don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out no need to take it slow
im stepping to you toe to toe
i should be scared honey maybe so

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

I don’t know what you’ve been told
but time is running out so spend it like its gold
im living like I’m 9 zeros
got no regrets even when I’m broke
yeah
im at my best when i got something
im wanting to steal
way too busy for them problems
and problems to feel (yeah yeah)
no stressing just obsessin with sealin the deal
ill take it in and let it go

but i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below

i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

oooooooooo
i aint worried
oooooooo
oh no no

i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
i aint worried bout it right now (right now)
swimmin in the floods, dancing on the clouds, below
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it
i aint worried bout it

Lyrics:
 
Time stood still
Just like a photograph
You made me feel
Like this would last forever
Looking in your eyes
I see my whole life

Ooh
They say you know it when you know it
And I know
Ooh
Promise that you’ll hold me close don’t let me go
Hey!

Take my heart don’t break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

I lose my mind
When I’m around you how I come alive
When I’m without you
I can’t help but feel so lost
I wanna give you all I’ve got

Ooh
They say you know it when you know it
And I know
Ooh
Promise that you’ll hold me close don’t let me go
Hey!

Take my heart don’t break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

Take my heart don’t break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along

►""Blinding Lights"" Lyrics:

Yeah
I been tryna call
I been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby
Oh, the city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

Lyrics
My grandma told your grandma, 
sittin’ by the fire
My grandmother told your grandma
I’m gonna set your flag on fire

My flag boy and your flag boy
sittin’ by the fire
My flag boy told your flag boy
I’m gonna set your flag on fire

Talkin’ ’bout hey now, hey now
Iko, Iko, an-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne

Hey Na Na Nah Na Na Nah

You already knowww

We New Orleans through and true,
From the Dixie Cups to the second line groove.
We been singing this song our whole lives,
Nola Songbird’s here to make it shine.
From block to block, the rhythm flows,
It’s in our step, it’s in our soul.
Poppin that, shakin that, betta make it clap,
Hands on your knees, now bring it back!
Feel that bass, let it hit cha chest,
Robin on the mic, we do it best.
Turn that beat up, let the speakers knock,
Come on, Robin—time to rock rock rock 

My flag boy and your flag boy
sittin’ by the fire
My flag boy told your flag boy
I’m gonna set your flag on fire.

Talkin’ ’bout hey now, hey now
Iko, Iko, and-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne

Talkin’ ’bout hey now, hey now
Iko, Iko, an-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne

Talkin’ ’bout hey now, hey now
Iko, Iko, an-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier

Lyrics:
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?

Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm

When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for

Lyrics:
There ain’t no gold
In this river
That I’ve been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope
In these waters
But I can’t bring myself to swim 
When I am drowning 
In this silence baby let me in
 
Go easy on me baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to 
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
 
There ain’t no room 
For things to change
When we are both so deeply 
Stuck in our ways
You can’t deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up 
 
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn’t even show

Lyrics: 
Call us what we are
Toxic from the start
Can’t pretend that I was in the dark 
When you met my friends
Didn’t even try with them
I should’ve known it then that you were

Jealous and possessive 
So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating

Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
And then
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

Ladies & Gentleman
I present to you, the ex

His favorite game is chess
Who would ever guess
Playing with the pieces in my chest 
Now he’s on the screen
Saying don’t leave
You stole that line from me
Cuz you’re just

Jealous and possessive
 So manipulating 
Honestly impressive
You had me participating
Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer 
You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

End end

I can forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings 
I’ll never forgive you for one thing my dear
You wasted my prettiest years
Back then
When I was running out of your place I said
I never wanna see your face
I meant
I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic

Uh huh
Cuz even when I said it was over
You heard Baby can you pull me in closer You were
Plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end

End end
We were toxic till the end 
End end

Lyrics:

I know just how to whisper,
and I know just how to cry;
I know just where to find the answers;
and I know just how to lie.
I know just how to fake it,
and I know just how to scheme;
I know just when to face the truth,
and then I know just when to dream.
And I know just where to touch you,
and I know just what to prove;
I know when to pull you closer,
and I know when to let you loose.
And I know the night is fading,
and I know that time's gonna fly;
and I'm never gonna tell you everything
I've got to tell you,
but I know I've got to give it a try.
And I know the roads to riches,
and I know the ways to fame;
I know all the rules
and then I know how to break 'em
and I always know the name of the game.",2011-03-23T10:34:26Z,438273104,2299835,55754,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ogoIxkPjRts/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogoIxkPjRts

LYRICS:
Think i only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to don’t leave me alone
you said you like my eyes and you like to make em roll
Treat me like a queen now you got me feelin thrown
 
But I can’t help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh blah bleh
I don’t want no one else
Baby I’m in too deep
Here’s a lil song i wrote
It’s about you and me
 
I’ll be honest
Lookin at u got me thinkin nonsense
cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good i had to jump the octave
I think i got an ex but i forgot him
And i can’t find my chill i must have lost it
I don’t even know I’m talking nonsense
 
I’m talking all around clock
I’m talking hope nobody knocks
I’m talkin opposite of soft
I’m talking wild wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the l o v e
How do you do this to me
 
But I can’t help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounded like blah blah bleh bleh
I don’t want no one else
Baby I’m in too deep
Here’s a lil song wrote
It’s about you and me
 
I’ll be honest
Lookin at u got me thinkin nonsense
cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When u got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good i had to hit the octave
I think i got an ex but i forgot him
And i can’t find my chill i musta lost it
I don’t even know I’m talking nonsense
I’m talking
I’m talking
I’m talking
 
This song catchier than chicken pox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning thought I’d write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz

Lyrics:

If you ever had a broken heart,
You know this song is for you.
If you ever felt the need to stop,
Then you might just feel like I do.
'Cause I'm tryna have a good time,
My friends said I'll be alright.
If you ever had a broken heart,
Then you feel me, feel me.

Now I'm out of a prison
You held me in for no reason.
No more lying, just let me be.

I'm so over you.
Ring ring,
Who's there?
I don't even have a clue.
Ring ring,
Who's there?
Kinda broken,
But I
Wish you well, you well, you well,
Wish you well, you well, you well.
Ring ring,
Who's there?
'Cause I'm so over you.

I fell in love in Mexico City,
Trouble, trouble.
Was a guy with a bunch of tattoos,
Problem, problem.
One, two, three, you got over here,
Four, five, six, and you disappeared.
I fell in love in Mexico City,
Trouble, trouble.

Now I'm out of a prison
You held me in for no reason.
No more lying, just let me be.

I'm so over you.
Ring ring,
Who's there?
I don't even have a clue.
Ring ring,
Who's there?
Kinda broken,
But I
Wish you well, you well, you well,
Wish you well, you well, you well.
Ring ring,
Who's there?

🎤  Lyrics:
She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morning
Light and the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
O' what a morning
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow boy
All that she wants is another baby

All that she wants - all that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever
It's a night for passion

But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants...

PEM0Vs8jf1w,JVKE - golden hour (official music video),"It was just 2 lovers, 
Sittin in the car 
Listening to Blonde
Fallin for eachother
pink & orange skies,
Feelin super childish
No donald glover 
Missed call from my mother
Like Where u at tonight
Got no alibi
I was all alone

With the love of my life 
Shes got glitter for skin
My Radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light

To see you shine
It's your golden hour
You slow down time
In your golden hour

we were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash
Driving nowhere fast 
Burnin through the summer
Radio on blast
make the moment last
She got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can u even imagine 
fallin like I did

For the love of my life 
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My Radiant beam in the night
I don’t need no light

Lyrics:
I don’t want to be alone tonight
It’s pretty clear that I’m not over you
I’m still thinking ‘bout the things you do
So I don’t want to be alone tonight

Can you light the fire
I need somebody who can take control
I know exactly what I need to do
Cos I don’t want to be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

Look what you made me do
I’m with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby I’m dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do
I’m with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby I’m dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger

I wasn’t even going out tonight
But boy I need to get you off my mind
I know exactly what I have to do
I don’t want to be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

Look what you made me do
I’m with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby I’m dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do
I’m with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby I’m dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger

Lyrics: 
Baby you can
Find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up
Don’t you wanna just
Come along for the ride

Oh my outfit so tight
You can see my heart beat tonight
I can take the heat
Baby best believe
That’s the moment I shine

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

Lately I’ve been
Moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat
You can count on me
I ain’t missing no steps

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place
Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place

Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night

About Dua Lipa:
Born and raised in London to Kosovar-Albanian parents Dua Lipa signed to Warner Records in 2015, releasing her self titled debut in 2017 which featured the hit singles, 'Be The One', 'IDGAF', 'Hotter Than Hell' & her first UK #1 hit 'New Rules'. 

Critical success soon followed as Dua Lipa picked up Brit Awards for 'Best Female Solo Artist' and 'Best British Breakthrough Act' as well as Grammy Awards for 'Best New Artist' and 'Best Dance Recording' for the track 'Electricity' in collaboration with Silk City.

Her second internationally acclaimed studio album 'Future Nostalgia' was released in 2020 and included the hit singles 'Don't Start Now, 'Break My Heart', 'Hallucinate' and 'Levitating', with the remix album 'Club Future Nostalgia' following shortly after featuring guest appearances from 'Blackpink', 'Missy Elliott', 'Madonna' and 'Gwen Stefani'.

Lyrics:
It must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
'Til the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love (it must have been love)
But it's over now

It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
From the moment we touched
'Til the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now

It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

Oh-oh (must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now), now
It must have been love (it must have been love)
But it's over now (but it's over now), now",2009-03-04T14:16:13Z,900573349,3637317,113458,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k2C5TjS2sh4/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2C5TjS2sh4

(Hey, Hey)
Bye, Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye...
Bye, Bye...
Oh, Oh..

I'm doin' this tonight,
You're probably gonna start a fight.
I know this can't be right.
Hey baby come on, 
I loved you endlessly,
When you weren't there for me.
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more 
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Bye Bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't nolie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye...
Bye Bye
Don't really wanna make it tough,
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy,
But it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Lyrics:

I miss the way we’d make up,
Been way too long now since I felt your lips.
I don’t know when we lost it,
I hope we’re still something we can fix.

Cause we were something real special,
Somehow we messed it all up.
Yeah I don’t know how we got here, but
I started thinking cause...

If we could learn to love again,
We wouldn’t have to think about the end.
If we could learn to love again,
F**k it and just forget the things we said.
I take back the hurt that I gave you,
I don’t want to miss it all.
If we could learn to love again,
We wouldn’t have to think about the end.

I wish that I could wake up,
And you would still be lying next to me.
Then maybe I could show you
Just how good we really used to be.

Cause we were something real special,
Somehow we messed it all up.
Yeah I don’t know how we got here, but
I started thinking cause...

If we could learn to love again,
We wouldn’t have to think about the end.
If we could learn to love again,
F**k it and just forget the things we said.
I take back the hurt that I gave you,
I don’t want to miss it all.
If we could learn to love again,
We wouldn’t have to think about the end.",2024-06-30T12:40:31Z,12065969,16930,222,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L9C9WiBBeRk/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9C9WiBBeRk

When @bastilledan sent me happier for the first time I was taken back. The amount of emotion that you could feel in the lyrics was crazy. As I listened to the song more and more it reminded me of so many things I’ve been through in my life. Toxic relationships, letting go of things I didn’t want to and just situations where happiness came with a sacrifice. Recently I lost my best friend, my companion, my life long friend. I wanted this video to embrace the pain that we feel losing or sacrificing something and the cycle of life that comes with it. I hope this song and video can bring closure in any situation you may be and make us all happier 💛

Lyrics:
Dear, love is a burning fire
Stay, 'cause then the flames grow higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart
It's easy, easy
Girl, this game can't last forever
Why we cannot live together
Try, don't let him take your love from me
You're no good, can't you see Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set her free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover
Stay, 'cause this boy wants to gamble
Stay, love is more than he can handle, girl
Oh, come on stay by me forever, ever
Why does he go on pretending
That, his love is never ending fate
Don't let him steal your love from me
You're no good, can't you see Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set her free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie

Lyrics:

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red bottoms
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (you've seen it)
I bought a crib just for the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Yeah, my receipts, be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag, "" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)

Lyrics:
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Lyrics

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up, to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh
That's what makes you beautiful

Lyrics:

There’s a party in my hotel bar
You were standing there across the room
Never meant to fall right in your arms
Is it love or is it Deja Vu?

So we went to a party in Mexico City
He told me ""bella come with me""
He told me ""bella come with me""
(Bella don’t you wanna come?)
Come back to mi cassa chica que passa?
Podria ser el questa noche te abrasa
(E e )
Noche te abrasa

Cuz baby you know I just came to say hi
You make me wanna pray for one last night
There’s something in your eyes
That got me so high
I hope we’ll never say our last goodbye

I can see the sun light up the sky
Oh last night it just flashed right by
Never thought that I’ll miss you so much
Now I’m trying to forget your touch

So we went to a party in Mexico City
He told me ""bella come with me""
He told me ""bella come with me""
(Bella don’t you wanna come?)
Come back to mi cassa chica que passa?
Podria ser el questa noche abrasa
(E e )
Noche te abrasa

Cuz baby you know I just came to say hi
You make me wanna pray for one last night
There’s something in your eyes
That got me so high
I hope we’ll never say our last goodbye
Cuz baby you know I just came to say hi
You make me wanna pray for one last night
There’s something in your eyes
That got me so high
I hope we’ll never say our last goodbye",2023-06-15T15:04:21Z,8354625,25219,525,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1j6Pfv6xS9o/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j6Pfv6xS9o

iy4mXZN1Zzk,Robbie Williams - Feel,"Feel (Official Music Video)

The first single from Robbie's fifth studio album 'Escapology', which entered the UK Album Chart at No. 1 in November 2002 where it stayed for six weeks (returning for one more week the following August). 'Feel' would become one of Robbie's biggest international hits, hitting the top spot in the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Romania.

Among the talent joining Robbie on 'Feel' - his seventeenth UK Top 40 hit - was bass player Phil Spalding, whose glittering career included contributions to Mike Oldfield's 1983 UK No. 4 hit 'Moonlight Shadow', and Sir Elton John's Grammy Award winning song 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight'.

The moody black and white promo video was directed by Robbie's frequent collaborator Vaughan Arnell. It was shot in Alberta, in western Canada and features actress Daryl Hannah.

Lyrics:
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment I start to replace‘
Cos now that they’re gone all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well time can heal but this won’t

So, before you go, was there something I could have said to make your heart beat better
If only I’d have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go, was there something I could have said to make it all stop hurting 
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless oh
Before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment I start to replay but all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold 
Well time can heal but this won’t 

So, before you go, was there something I could have said to make your heart beat better
If only I’d have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go, was there something I could have said to make it all stop hurting
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless oh
Before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I’d have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we’ll never know 
You know, you know

Before you go, was there something I could have said to make your heart beat better
If only I’d have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go, was there something I could have said to make it all stop hurting 
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless oh
Before you go

Lyrics: Dynasty - MIIA

Some days it's hard to see
If I was a fool, or you, a thief
Made it thru the maze to find my one in a million
Now you're just a page torn from the story I'm living

And all I gave you is gone 
Tumbled like it was stone 
Thought we built a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake 
Thought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made 
Thought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up

The scar I can't reverse 
When the more it heals the worse it hurts 
Gave u every piece of me, no wonder it's missing
Don't know how to be so close to someone so distant

And all I gave you is gone 
Tumbled like it was stone 
Thought we built a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake 
Thought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made 
Thought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up
It all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down
It all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell down, it all fell down
It all fell, it all fell down, it all fell down",2016-02-04T18:21:27Z,140867124,1611168,43030,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5-ZiKXrnvog/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ZiKXrnvog

Lyrics

We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space
Outer space, light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave
No, we just wanna be right now, right, ri-ri-right now
And what we see, is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco 'til the light's out
Music's on, I'm waking up
We start the fire, and we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
There's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, sleeping now

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn (ooh)
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn (ooh)

We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out
We can light it up, up, up
So they can't put it out, out, out

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn (let it burn)

When the lights turned down, they don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky (burn, burn, burn, burn, we gonna let it burn, burn, let it burn)
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire
And we're gonna let it burn

Lyrics

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
And thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know
I know and now

When all is done, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
Oh what I hoped would be impossible
Impossible (Impossible)
Impossible (Impossible)
(Impossible)

Impossible
(Impossible) 
Impossible

You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Lyrics:

Could you be
The rain that's falling on me?
Into my life when you sway,
Would you stay?

I give myself to you,
There’s nothing I can do.
Counting on you everyday,
My desert's rain.

Ladida, ladida,
My mind goes numb, numb, numb.
Ladida, ladida,
When my heart beats dum, dum, dum.

Ladida, ladida,
My mind goes numb, numb, numb.
Ladida, ladida,
When my heart goes dum, dum, dum.

Want you to be
The light that shines in the dark.
I can feel in my heart,
In my heart.
All my love
Goes deep like the ocean,
Put my body in motion,
In motion.

I give myself to you,
There’s nothing I can do.
Counting on you every day,
My desert's rain.

Ladida, ladida,
My mind goes numb, numb, numb.
Ladida, ladida,
When my heart beats dum, dum, dum.

Ladida, ladida,
My mind goes numb, numb, numb.
Ladida, ladida,
When my heart goes dum, dum, dum.

Stuck in my head
Like a symphony,
With you, it feels like a fantasy, ah ah.
You're the music to my galaxy,
Stuck in my head
Like a symphony.

Ladida, ladida,
My mind goes numb, numb, numb.
Ladida, ladida,
When my heart beats dum, dum, dum.

Ladida, ladida,
My mind goes numb, numb, numb.
Ladida, ladida,
When my heart goes dum, dum, dum.",2024-04-17T09:00:37Z,4643129,9404,100,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iXYroDymuMk/hqdefault.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXYroDymuMk
